# FCC-projects

This repo serves as a place for me to compile all of my projects as I work through the [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) courses and certifications. By making my work publically visable through this repository, I hope to show *real, documented* proof of my knowledge and ability as a developer. My intention is to treat the stated project requirements as a baseline, and to produce a high-quality product that I will continue to work on and improve.
