# Survey-Form

The first proper project, after finishing the HTML and CSS fundamental courses. Not much that I didn't know, though I did pick up some useful new properties, learned more semantic tags (`<article>`, `<section`>, etc) for SEO, and learned more about proper `<form>` setup.

## TODO
Initial commit is very barebones. The CSS is currently empty, so it's extremely ugly. For such a simple project, though, I think I'm OK to wait until I see the full form to make a nice style.
* Flesh out the survey with a couple more useful questions.
* Start styling the page. Classes should be set up to get going.
 * Add a "techy" background image. Circuitry, floating monospaced characters, etc.
